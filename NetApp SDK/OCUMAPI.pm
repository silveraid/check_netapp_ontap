=head1 NAME

OCUMAPI - Contains the definitions and description of API Bindings for OnCommand Unified Manager server 6.0 or later

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	 my $s = NaServer->new($server, 1, 0); # create NaServer (server context)
	 $s->set_admin_user('admin', 'password'); # provide username and password
	 $s->set_server_type('OCUM'); # set the server type to OCUM for OnCommand Unified Manager 6.0 or later

	 eval{ 
		 my $output = $s->system_about(); # use binding for system-about API
		 print "OCUM server version is: $output->{version}\n"; # extract the required parameter from output

	 };
	 if($@) { # check for any exception
		 my ($error_reason, $error_code) = $@ =~ /(.+)\s\((\d+)\)/;  # parse out error reason and error code
		 print "Error Reason: $error_reason  Code: $error_code\n"
	 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

NetApp Manageability SDK 5.3.1 provides support for Perl API bindings for both Data ONTAP APIs and OnCommand Unified Manager APIs.
The Perl API bindings libraries contain interfaces to establish a connection with either the Data ONTAP server or the OnCommand Unified Manager server.
By using these libraries, you can create Perl applications to access and manage the Data ONTAP server or OnCommand Unified Manager server.

NetApp Manageability SDK 5.3.1 Perl API bindings provide a runtime library NaServer.pm, which is available at <installation_folder>/lib/perl/NetApp.
This library file enables you to establish a server connection, send requests and receive responses, and interpret error messages.
Each binding can be called as a subroutine of NaServer module which in turn invokes the corresponding Data ONTAP or OnCommand Unified Manager API.

If both destination-path and use-snapshot-restore-volume inputs are specified and use-snapshot-restore-volume is set to true, then EINVALIDINPUT is returned. Leading '/' is optional in the destination-path. Examples of the destination-path are "dir1/dir2", "/dir1/dir2" or "/". If the destination-path is "/dir1/dir2", it is interpreted as "&lt;destination-volume&gt;/dir1/dir2". '/' must be used in place of '\' when restoring to or from a Windows path.

Source path is relative to the Snapshot copy location and it can be a directory or a file. If a directory is specified, the files and subdirectories of that directory are restored. Leading '/' is optional in the source-path. Examples of the source-path are "dir1/dir2" or "/dir1/dir2" or "/dir1/dir2/file1". If the source-path is "/dir1/dir2", it is interpreted as "&lt;source-volume&gt;/.snapshot/&lt;snapshot&gt;/dir1/dir2". '/' must be used in place of '\' when restoring to or from a Windows path.

=begin html

<br>The flag to use the snapshot-restore-volume API. This flag is applicable only for in-place restoration of a volume from a local Snapshot copy. When true, this flag indicates that Data ONTAP's snapshot-restore-volume API is used for volume restoration. As a side-effect, any Snapshot copies created after this Snapshot copy creation no longer remain on the source volume after the restore. In effect, after the reversion, the volume is in the same state as it was when the Snapshot copy was created. If the volume is in a SnapMirror relationship, then only Snapshot copies that were created after the last SnapMirror update could be used. Otherwise, the job will fail indicating that the volume has a locked Snapshot copy. If this flag is set true, then both source-path and destination-path must not be specified. Otherwise, EINVALIDINPUT is returned. <br> <b>WARNING</b>: The storage system will reboot after the restore if the specified snapshot-identifier belongs to the root volume of a node Vserver. See Data ONTAP's guide for the "snapshot-restore-volume" API for more information. <br> When this flag is not specified or false, the snapshot-restore-volume API is not used. Default is false.

Full name of an object. This typedef is an alias for the builtin ZAPI type <b>string</b>. An object full name conforms to all the rules of an obj-name, except that the full name may be up to 255 characters long. <p> Full names are created by concatenating an object name with any parent object names, so as to create a unique name for an object. The format of full names is as follows: <ul> <li> <B>cluster</B> full names are the either the fully-qualified domain name or the IP address of the cluster. <li> <B>cluster-node</B> full names are the either the fully-qualified domain name or the IP address of the cluster. <li> <B>aggregate</B> full names are the cluster-node name and the aggregate name, separated by a colon, e.g. <I>cluster-node:aggr0</I>. <li> <B>volume</B> full names are the vserver name and the volume name, separated by ":/", e.g. <I>vserver:/volume</I>. Note this does not include the "/vol" prefix. Volume and aggregate full names are distinguished by the presence of a forward slash after the colon. <li> <B>qtree</B> full names are the containing volume full name and the qtree name, separated by a slash, e.g. <I>vserver:/volume/qtree</I>. The data not contained by any qtree may be represented by "-", e.g. <I>vserver:/volume/-</I>. <li> <B>lun</B> full names are either a volume or qtree full name and the LUN path, separated by a slash, e.g. <I>vserver:/volume/LUN</I> or <I>vserver:/volume/qtree/LUN</I>. <li> <B>initiator-group</B> full names are vserver name and the initiator group name, separated by a colon, e.g. <I>vserver:igroup</I>. <li> <B>export-policy</B> full names are vserver name and the policy name, separated by a colon, e.g. <I>vserver:policy-name</I>. <li> <B>lif</B> full names are a cluster, cluster-node, or vserver name and the interface name, separated by a colon, e.g. <I>cluster-name|cluster-node-name|vserver-name:lif</I>. <li> <B>port-set</B> full names are the vserver name and the portset name, separated by a colon, e.g. <I>vserver:portset</I>. <li> <B>fcp-target</B> full names are the cluster-node name and the target name, separated by a colon, e.g. <I>cluster-node:target</I>. </ul> For any object not listed above, the obj-name and obj-full-name are identical.

=head2 obj-id

=begin html

Identification number (ID) for an object. This typedef is an alias for the builtin ZAPI type <b>integer</b>. Object IDs are unsigned integers in the range [1..2^31 - 1]. In some contexts, an object ID is also allowed to be 0, which is interpreted as a null value, e.g., a reference to no object at all. <p> The ID for an object is always assigned by the system; the user is never allowed to assign an ID to an object. Therefore, an input element of type <b>obj-id</b> is always used to refer to an existing object by its ID. The ZAPI must specify the object's object type (e.g. cluster, volume, aggregate, etc.). Some ZAPIs allow the object to be one of several different types. <p> If the value of an <b>obj-id</b> input element does not match the ID of any existing object of the specified type or types, then typically the ZAPI fails with error code <b>EOBJECTNOTFOUND</b>. A ZAPI may deviate from this general rule, for example, it may return a more specific error code. In either case, the ZAPI specification must document its behavior.

=head2 obj-name

=begin html

Name of an object. This typedef is an alias for the built in ZAPI type <b>string</b>. An object name must conform to the following format: <ul> <li> It must contain between 1 and 64 characters. <li> It may start with any character and may contain any combination of characters, except that it may not consist solely of decimal digits ('0' through '9'). <li> In some contexts, a name may be the empty string (""), which is interpreted as a null value, e.g., a reference to no object at all. </ul> The behavior of a ZAPI when it encounters an error involving an <b>obj-name</b> input element depends on how the ZAPI uses the input element. Here are the general rules: <ul> <li> If the input name element is used to create a new object with the given name, or rename an existing object to that name, and the name does not conform to the above format, then the ZAPI fails with error code <b>EINVALIDINPUT</b>. Note that because <b>EINVALIDINPUT</b> is such a common error code, ZAPI specifications are not required to document cases when they may return it. <li> If the input name element is used to refer to an existing object with that name, and there is no object with that name, then the ZAPI fails with error code <b>EOBJECTNOTFOUND</b>. Generally the ZAPI specification documents cases when it may return this error code. </ul> A ZAPI may deviate from these general rules, for example, it may return more specific error codes. In such cases, the ZAPI specification must document its behavior. <p> If an input name element is used to refer to an existing object, then the ZAPI specification must specify which object type (e.g. cluster, vserver, volume etc.) is allowed. Some ZAPIs allow the object to be one of several different types. See the description of obj-full-name for examples of valid input formats. <p> Note that there is no requirement that all object names must be unique. However, the names for some specific types of objects are constrained such that no two objects of that type may have the same name.

=head2 obj-status

=begin html

A status value which can be associated with an object. This typedef is an alias for the builtin ZAPI type <b>string</b>. The severity associated with an event has this type. <p> Possible values are: 'normal', 'warning', 'error', 'critical'. <ul> <li>normal: An object has normal status when it is working within the thresholds specified. <li>warning: An object has the warning status when an event related to the object occurred that an administrator should know about. The event will not cause service disruption. <li>error: An object has error status when it does not cause any service disruption, but it may affect performance. <li>critical: An object has critical status when it is still performing, but service disruption may occur if corrective action is not taken immediately. </ul> In some contexts, it is important that severities are ordered (as above). For example, an alert might be triggered if an event with a given severity "or worse" occurs. In this example, worse means "after" in the list above.
